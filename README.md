        <h1>Features:</h1>
        <u><b>Interactive UI Components:</b></u>The app features reusable UI components such as input fields, buttons,
        and modal windows, enhancing user experience and making interactions intuitive.
        <br>
        <u><b>Custom Hook:</b></u><em>useHttp</em> Leveraging the power of custom hooks, the app efficiently manages
        HTTP requests, providing seamless communication with the backend server while maintaining code readability and
        reusability.
        <br>
        <u><b>Context Providers:</b></u>Instead of Redux, the app utilizes two context providers (CartContext and
        UserProgressContext) to manage global state and facilitate data flow between components. This approach offers a
        lightweight alternative to Redux, while still providing centralized state management capabilities.
